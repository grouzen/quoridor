Need to implement:
- screens manager
  We need abstraction for various types of screens
  which will be presented, such as menu screen,
  main gameplay screen, score screen, etc.
  - scene manager
    Manages scene graph, makes intersection and bounding.
    - scene graph
      In fact in this game there is no such amount of objects
      and all of them are always visible, so I need think about
      realy it must be a tree or graph
    
Links:
- about all: scene managment, scene graph, screens, states, etc
